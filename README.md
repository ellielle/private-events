# Private Events
## About
The idea behind this [project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/associations) is to create 
an event planning website similar to [Eventbrite](http://www.eventbrite.com/) where users can create events and send out
invitations.

A user can create events. A user can attend many events. An event can be attended by many users. This will require you
to model many-to-many relationships and also to be very conscious about your foreign keys and class names 
(hint: you won’t be able to just rely on Rails’ defaults like you have before).

Note: Passwords for accounts are specifically not required per project instructions.
